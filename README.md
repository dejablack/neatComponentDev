#neatWhiskey v.01.3

##About
This framework is still in the 'works', but as of right now you can use it for production and or development.
######Under The Hood
<hr />
1. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
2. [Jade Templating Engine](http://jade-lang.com/)
3. [Stylus CSS Preprocessor](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)
4. [Jeet Grid](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet)
5. [Rupture: Media Queries](http://jenius.github.io/rupture/)
6. [nib CSS3 extensions](http://visionmedia.github.io/nib/)
7. [axis-css](http://roots.cx/axis/)
8. It also includes all your other expected gulp-boilderplate goodies, autoprefixer, uglify, concat, img optimiser, ect.


##Usage
<hr />
######Pretty Typical Gulp Commnands
1. Gulp Watch for dev.
2. Gulp Build for production
- !important, as of right now it works with nib and axis-css, but these two do conflict in some areas. That being said, I would recommend that you remove one (I typically remove nib). I just added for flexablity.


##To-Do
1. Clean up the template files
2. Better Orginization plus comments
3. Browserify
4. Modularize Gulp File
5. [Unison.js](http://bjork24.github.io/Unison/)
6. Yeoman Generator

- Also I am planning on adding some helpful component flies, like buttons, accordian, defult nav, mobile nav. This will help speed up production and prototyping. 
- Any help is appreciated. I have only been coding for 6 months so if you have any recommendations or such I am all ears.


ps. I live in Delafield Wisconsin and I am currently freelancing, but am in the process of starting a studio. Thus, if you are a fellow code lover in the area I would love to talk.
